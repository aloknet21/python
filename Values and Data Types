Values and Data Types
A value is one of the fundamental things — like a word or a number — that a program manipulates. Some values are 5 (the result when we add 2 + 3), and "Hello, World!". These objects are classified into different classes, or data types: 4 is an integer, and “Hello, World!” is a string, so-called because it contains a string or sequence of letters. You (and the interpreter) can identify strings because they are enclosed in quotation marks.

Example:-

print(3.2)
print("Hello, World!")
